Nextypay is one of our targets in Nexty e-commerce system to widen the payment with Nexty Coin (NTY), one of the best crypto currencies on the world at the moment.

== Description ==

The Nextypay plugin allows you to accept NTY payment via Nextypay gateway on your WordPress site easily.

One click payment via Nextypay with a remember me feature. Responsive design so it is compatible with all devices and browsers.

Your customers will be redirected to the "Thank You" page after the payment. This page shows them a QR code and links to download mobile app
(the order that they just placed).These apps help your customers to transfer NTY over Blockchain, from customer wallet to your wallet, which is settingable in backend.
its just a option to make the transfer easier with hexed code from the QR code. This plugin load full Blocks from the Blockchain and save any Transaction, which content your Wallet as to_wallet. For the Blocks
loading, a short guide for linux cronjob added in the root folder of plugin (30 blocks loaded every minute, because Nexty blockchain create Blocks every 2 seconds).
How many blocks to save is settingable too in backend (to prevent a block revert). Once the order enough paid, the plugin changes order status to completed, and notifies to customer.

Ans: The price will be updated from Coinmarketcap.com and converted to the equivalent amount, which will be shown in the "total amount"

Ans: The key features of NTY is instant transfer and Zero transfer fee. This means that we do not charge extra fees like Paypal. The matter seems to be nothing with a $10 goods, but if the fee accounts for 1% of a $1,000,000 item, it does matter.
